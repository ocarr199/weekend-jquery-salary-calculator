# Project Name

Monthly Spending Calculator

## Description
This is a project to help a company budget their employees salaries. There are inputs for First Name,
Last Name, Employee ID, Job Title and Annual Salary. These are all added to a table and the annual salary for each employee is converted into their monthly salary and added to the total monthly expense below the table.
If not all fields are completed, or the annual salary is not a number the user gets a dismissable alert making them aware of their specific mistake. If the total monthly expense goes above 20 thousand the 
total monthly expense recieves a red background and a warning that they are spending too much. 
Each employee in the list has a delete button and if someone is deleted then the monthly expense is adjusted and if this results in monthly expnense returning below 20 thousand then the red background and warning will
be removed.
This project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap.css and Bootstrap.js
